This tutorial aims to provide an overview of generative adversarial networks (GANs) and their use in generating music. The format of the tutorial will include lectures, demonstration of sample systems and technical results with illustrative musical examples.

- We will start by discussing the scope of music generation and introducing various tasks that can broadly be regarded as music generation. We will then explain the machine learning fundamentals for GANs and present some interesting applications of GANs in other fields to showcase their potentials.

- In the second section, we will go through a demo project on Google Colab. The demo project will cover the following topics: preparing the training data, implementing the models, monitoring the training process and evaluating the results.

- The third section will contain the case studies of four different tasks---symbolic melody generation, symbolic arrangement generation, symbolic musical style transfer and musical audio generation. We will conclude the tutorial by discussing the current limitations of GAN-based models and suggesting some possible future research directions.

The tutorial is targeted to students and newcomers who are interested in or working on music generation research, and also machine learning specialists who want to see how GANs can be applied to music generation.
